1) You cant iterate single object .Use speacial function called [models_to_dict]  [from django.forms.models import models_to_dict]
2) Multiple objects are iterable in queryset.Convert all in dictionary ,which gets converted dictionaries inside dictionary. 
   then convert that dictionary into list.and pass it to front end.
3)Put---> Used for updating the whole object. use Pk for extracting the particular data  and the use serailizer class for
  getting input. the just update the serailizer data with our model.

4) Patch---> used to update the partial object  and we have to use PUT methods raw data to sending input.We cant just use form data to 
   send single value.In patch we have to pass the three parameters insted of three [data=request.data, queary object and partial=true]
   partial generally tales us that the data is goin to update partially.(partially bypass the null validations)
